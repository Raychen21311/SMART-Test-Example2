## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please use the **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature on GitHub:
1. Go to the "Security" tab of this repository.
2. Click on "Advisories".
3. Click "Report a vulnerability" to submit your finding privately.

## Our Commitment
- We will acknowledge your report within 3 business days.
- We will provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
- Once fixed, we will publish a Security Advisory and credit you for your discovery.
